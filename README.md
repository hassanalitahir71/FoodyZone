**Foody Zone (Practice Project)**


Foody Zone is a practice-based React application developed under the guidance of an instructor. The project integrates a backend API with a frontend application, where data is fetched dynamically and the user interface is rendered based on the backend response. The main objective of this project is to gain practical experience in building modern, data-driven React applications.

The application is developed using React functional components and makes use of React Hooks, specifically useState for state management and useEffect for handling side effects such as API data fetching. Styling is implemented using styled-components, including createGlobalStyle, to achieve a clean, maintainable, and scalable styling architecture.

This project demonstrates the use of API integration to fetch and manage backend data, dynamic rendering of food items, category-based filtering, and search functionality. The frontend is structured using a component-based approach, allowing for better code organization and reusability.

Overall, Foody Zone serves as a learning-focused project designed to strengthen understanding of React hooks, styled-components, and frontend–backend interaction. The project has been created strictly for educational and practice purposes under instructor supervision.
